# Security

Vulnerabilities should be reported via the following process:

- Open a Github Issue & mention it's about a vulnerability, but **do not** post 
  the actual vulnerability itself.  
- The authors should suggest a private channel to discuss further.  

> Note: Only the latest versions receive security fixes
